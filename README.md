Three dumb kids trying to make a game.
Here is how to get the GitHub repository into VSCode.                                                                                                                                      
Make a brand new terminal, and the command line argument is: winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
Then you will need to install the extension called: GitHub Pull Requests
Next thing to do, is to type in the command line: python
This will install the Python language that will allow you to compile code written in Python.
You will have to click the install button to confirm the download.
Next, you need to put in your name and email in this format: git config --global user.name "Brandon Gonzales", then on a new line do this: git config --global user.email "brandong202123@gmail.com" make sure to use the quotes as well and not to use my name and emails, use your own. That should be all the setup you need to begin testing code and writing. Ethan if you need me or Nate to explain GitHub stuff to you we can.
